<!-- Version 3.2.2 Changes:
	1. mets_rosetta.xsd now conforms to xsd 1.1 only. Please use tools that support this version.
	2. Add support for custom structMap types:
	   PHYSICAL and LOGICAL will remain Rosetta-reserved. They will continue
	   to be validated as before, only now as type "structMapType-Ros", and their divs as "divType-Ros" - see below.
	   Rosetta will validate and store, but the IE Viewer will not deliver custom structMap types.
	   These will be treated as custom, which will be validated according to the LOC validation schema (version 1.6).
